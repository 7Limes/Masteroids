 MASTEROIDS - How to Play
==========================

I don't have time to make an actual tutorial so you're getting a tk.ScrolledText instead. Hope you like monospace!

This is an Asteroids-style roguelike, so just try and make it as far as you can.
Collect coins by destroying gold asteroids and enemy ships.
Use these coins to purchase upgrades for your ship.

You can upgrade your ship when you get to the safe zone at the end of a path.

By the way, if you take one hit, you're dead.


-= Controls =-
Mouse - Aim ship
LMB   - Shoot
RMB   - Hook
W     - Thrust
S     - Brake


-= Hook =-
Your hook enables you to latch onto asteroids and swing around them.
Point at an astroid and hold Right Click to hook onto it.


That's basically all there is to it! Have fun!
